        <h2 class="sheryl-title">Who Is Sheryl Sandberg?</h2>

        <p class="about-sheryl">Born in 1969 in Washington, D.C., Sheryl Sandberg attended Harvard as an undergrad and for business school, her early career taking her to the World Bank and then the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Following a successful stint as VP of online sales and operations at Google, Sandberg has served as COO of Facebook since 2008. In 2013, she published the best-selling Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead. </p>

         <h2 class="sheryl-title"> <b>Facebook COO</b></h1> 

          <p class="about-hres">In March 2008, Sandberg joined Facebook as the company’s chief operating officer. From her COO post, Sandberg oversees Facebook’s business operations, specifically helping Facebook scale its operations and expand its global footprint. She also oversees sales management, business development, human resources, marketing, public policy, privacy and communications.</p>

          <p class="about-hres">For her duties, Sandberg has been richly rewarded, and she made her way onto the billionaires’ list in early 2014, based on her stake in Facebook. Additionally, she became the first female member of the company's board of directors in 2012.</p> 

          <p class="about-hres">Sandberg's tenure at Facebook has not been devoid of controversy. With the social media behemoth facing scrutiny over its complicity in election meddling, she was compelled to defend the company's actions before the Senate in 2018. Late that year, it was reported that she had instructed the communications staff to examine the finances of George Soros, following the billionaire investor's criticism of Facebook and other big tech companies.</p>

    <div class="about-book">
      <p class="about-hres">Sheryl Sandberg’s Lean In is a massive cultural phenomenon and its title has become an instant catchphrase for empowering women. Ask most women whether they have the right to equality at work and the answer will be a resounding yes, but ask the same women whether they'd feel confident asking for a raise, a promotion, or equal pay, and some reticence creeps in. The statistics, although an improvement on previous decades, are certainly not in women's favour – of 197 heads of state, only twenty-two are women. Women hold just 20 percent of seats in parliaments globally, and in the world of big business, a meagre eighteen of the Fortune 500 CEOs are women. In Lean In, Sheryl Sandberg – Facebook COO and one of Fortune magazine's Most Powerful Women in Business – draws on her own experience of working in some of the world's most successful businesses and looks at what women can do to help themselves, and make the small changes in their life that can effect change on a more universal scale.</p>
