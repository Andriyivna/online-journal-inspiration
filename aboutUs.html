          ISPIRATION - THIS IS SLOW MEDIA ABOUT PEOPLE WHO 
          SUCCESSFUL IN THE DIFFERENT INDUSTRY
        </h2>

        <p class="text-about-us"  >
          In this project we will focus on the topic of inspirational people. We want to motivate everyone to develop their creative potential, to talk about successful practical cases and to provide information that will help start their projects and implement ideas.  </p>
  

        <p class="text-about-us">Why?</p>  

        <p class="text-about-us"> Because, first, we consider creativity as a driving force for the development of modern society. We are convinced that this is not an abstract concept, but a characteristic inherent in every person from birth. We just need to develop.</p>

        <p class="text-about-us">  Secondly, because it is interesting to our readers. Leader stories have always attracted the greatest interest in the audience. We decided to talk about it even more.</p>

        <p class="text-about-us"> Third, because it's a challenge.</p>
