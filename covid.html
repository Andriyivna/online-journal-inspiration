          <h2 class="covid-danger" >Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus.</h2>
          <p class="about-hres">
            The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter) with people who are unwell.
          </p>

          <h2 class="covid-danger">How it spreads</h2>
          <p class="about-hres">   
            Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an infected person when they cough or sneeze. It also spreads when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it, then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
